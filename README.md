# Current Roadmap

## Roadmap key
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ðŸ”´ | Very little understanding |
| ðŸŸ  | Learning stage: Learning how this works and if it is a good idea|
| ðŸŸ¡ | Design stage: Scoping the feature and figuring out how it will work |
| ðŸŸ¢ | Implementation stage: Writing code & Testing|
| âœ… | Implementation done |

## Jupiter v1
Goals: Spherical mass simulation with components of hydrostatic equilibrium.
- âœ… Particle Creation from initial conditions
- âœ… Rendering of particles as spheres
- âœ… SPH calculation of Kernels
- âœ… SPH calculation of Density
- âœ… Naive Gravity O(n^2) 
- âœ… Pressure equation of state
- âœ… Acceleration and time integration of position
- âœ… Skybox and directional lighting
- âœ… Variable smothing kernel lengths
- âœ… Hydrostatic equilibrium w/ 3k particles and fake units

## Jupiter v2
Goal: Achieve hydrostatic equilbrium with a jupiter-sized planet
- âœ… Faster Kernel Calculation (6.5 ms for 3k particles)
- âœ… Gravity in O(NlogN) using Physics system Tree
- ðŸŸ¢ Gather data on gravity optimization
- ðŸŸ¡ Units & Scale
  - Allow choice of units/scale for internal calculations at compile time
  - Alter Authoring and physical data display to display with units
  - First version: 
    - Use CGS for I/O
    - Define compile-time scales in space, time, mass for internal calc 
- ðŸŸ  Make gravity significantly faster at 3k - 10k particle regime
- ðŸŸ  Unit Tests for mathematics
  - Should be able to spot-test most math routines using Unity's testing system

## Leave the editor
Goal: Standalone executable
- ðŸŸ  Mouse-based Camera control in built executable
- ðŸŸ  Windows build which runs standalone
- ðŸŸ  Text UI for aggregate physical quantities
  - Totals: Energy, Momentum, Mass
  - Average/max/min: Temp, Pressure, Density, Grav Field
- ðŸŸ  2D labeled planar grid for visual scale

## Heat and Luminosity.
Goals: Sufficient physics to render a planet rather than particles.
- ðŸ”´ Heat equation of state.
  - Temperature affects pressure and pressure affects temperature
- ðŸ”´ Render particle groups as blackbodies
  - Temperature at surface should determine BB spectrum, color, luminosity
  - How to Map abstract particles -> pixels 
  - What's enough particles that it's a group?
  - Handling reflected vs transmitted light

## Demo-polish
Goal: Polished experience which clearly showcases current capabilities, makes program correctness obvious to a technical audience
- ðŸ”´ Ability to specify initial conditions at runtime
- ðŸŸ  UI for launching and choosing initial state (depends on runtime initial conditions)
  - A Gaseous planet
  - A collision of gaseous planets
  - A over-rotating gaseous planet

## Future
Cool things that aren't a priority yet, but have come up as options.
- ðŸŸ  Gravity Kernel which conserves energy
  - See Price & Monaghan 2007
  - Affects particle kernel, because kernels are related by derivatives.
- ðŸ”´ Graph UI to plot physical quantities
  - Spatial graph of field quantities
  - Time graph of aggregate quantities
  - Consider: https://github.com/pandr/unity-debug-overlay
- ðŸ”´ Remove Unity.Physics Dependency from collision
  - Construct broadphase-similar accelleration structure
  - Rewrite kernel and gravity systems to use this
- ðŸ”´ Expand possible initial conditions
  - Initial group velocity
  - Initial group angular momentum
  - Nonuniform density
  - Automatic (and potentially non-uniform) particle size
- ðŸŸ  Remove Unity.Physics Dependency on time integration
  - Don't allow objects to have PhysicsVelocity or other components that cause physics to run
  - Update positions based on velocity in an independent job
  - Unlocks more complex time integration choices (runge-kutta, leapfrog)
- ðŸ”´ Simulation tests
  - Put some particles in a space, optionally evolve time, test that physical properties converge to expected values.
- ðŸ”´ Numerical error checking
  - Surveil calculation for floating point issues (Sampling, FP exceptions?)
- ðŸ”´ Move Physics Computations to Compute Shader
  - Primary reason would be performance
  - Should target specific situations
